# DISCORD PROFILE PICTURE GRABBER

This is a **SIMPLE** website made with the API I made [HERE](https://github.com/SamerAbukhader/discordpfpapi), and it retrieves the users **PROFILE AVATAR**!

# Files
ALL FILES ARE OPEN EXCEPT `index.js` BECAUSE IT HAS DISCORD TOKEN BOT INFORMATION!

# WEBSITE
I have made a GitHub hosted Website using this Repository right [HERE](https://samerabukhader.github.io/discord-profile-picture-grabber/)
